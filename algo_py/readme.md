# `algo_py` directory

Contains all "modules" (.py) needed for algo classes

## Utilisation

To import the module `xxx.py`

```python
from algo_py import xxx
```

- either the file containing the import is in the same directory as `algo_py`

- or the directory containing `algo_py` has been added to "PYTHONPATH" (recommended, see below)
