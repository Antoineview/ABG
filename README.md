# Binary Trees 🌳

Welcome to the **Binary Trees Project**! This document provides an overview of binary trees, including key concepts and measurements like size and height. 🚀

## What is a Binary Tree? 🤔
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Measurements 📏

- **Size**: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes. It can be calculated recursively.

- **Height**: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. It is an important metric for understanding the efficiency of tree operations.
